# Class Eight Notes

equal == returns true if operands are equal 

!= true if both are not equal 

= = = no spaces returns true if operands are equal **and** the same type 

!== strict not equal, returns true if operand same type but not equal 

loops:  they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)

A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement

  while (condition is true){execute this code}

let age;
let guess= 3
while (age>21 && guess<=3){prompt= "are you over 18?"}

for (i=0; )
