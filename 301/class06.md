# 6. Node Js

## Why this is important:

This is important because Node Js is a powerful that lets us run JS on our machines.

## Node JS

Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, itâ€™s a JavaScript runtime.

Npm is a package manager that comes with node, but it's suggested to use a version manager or binaries instead.

Npm is also the world's largest software registry.

Global install: npm install -g *package name*

Local install to project only: create/auto populate a package.json file npm init -y

Node is single-threaded and event-driven:

  - everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event. 

  - asynchronous, events will process as they come in.

  - little overhead, and consequently itâ€™s capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections

  - built module to help it implement cloning strategy on single server.
