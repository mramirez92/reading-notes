# 07. REST

## This is important because:

Knowing how REST works will help us be able to better implement API and functionality to our web apps.

## REST

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
  
    - One of the writer for the first web servers that send documents across the internet, http

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

    - techniques were meant to communicate with a small group of machines

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

    - Helps us get reach files store in a server via url.

4-7:
- GET: retrieve
- POST: adds
- PUT: replaces
- PATCH: partially updates

## API Keys

I did obtain keys to all APIs required.

## Things I want to know more about:
I want more hands-on experience with implementing API's.
