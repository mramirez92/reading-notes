# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## Why is this important:
Working with people from different background can help us learn and see things in different ways. Surrounding ourselves with more than one type of perspective can propel us to expand our knowledge and inspire new thoughts and ideas. 

1. Home PC's started to become a household thing.

2. Males growing up with computers puts women who didn't grow up with a one at a disadvantage because of their lack of hands on experience with computers.

1. Diversity efforts are successful when company leaders are committed and fully support those efforts.

2. Diversity brings in different perspectives that can inspire innovation and creativity.

3. A diverse company will have more insight to different groups and can tailor their products to work not just for one community, but for most if not all.
