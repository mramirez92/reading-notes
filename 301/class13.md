# 13. More CRUD

## Why is this important:
Our backend might need to make connections to web servers, we need to implement functionality using CRUD.


## CRUD

These four major functions are used to interact with database applications:

CREATE
READ
UPDATE
DELETE

HTTP communicates with a web server using:

POST
GET
PUT
DELETE

1. Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?
    - PUT

2. Which REST methods require an ID parameter?
    - DELETE and PUT

---- 

1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
    - REST (HTTP)protocols allow us use CRUD through API


2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
    
    - create server file
    - install middleware
    - connect to a DB and follow schema rules for that DB
    - create endpoints that use CRUD
    - test and deploy
