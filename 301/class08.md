# 8. REST

## Why this is important:

Creating a backend that connects our frontend successfully is important. It's needs to be done in an efficient and clear manner.

Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for building distributed systems based on hypermedia.
Although  REST API's use HTTP as their application protocol, REST is an independent protocol.

- REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.
- Resources contain a URI (unique resource identifier)
        - `https://adventure-works.com/orders/1`
        - based on nouns (resource) and not verbs (operations of resource)

- GET:  retrieves representation of resource at URI, HTTP status code 200 (OK)
- POST: creates new resource at URI, HTTP status code 201 (Created)
-PUT: partial update of resource; HTTP status code 201 (Created), if method updates an existing resource, it returns either 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content)
- DELETE: removes resource at specified URI, HTTP status code 204 (No Content), if resource not found returns HTTP 404 (Not Found).

1. What does REST stand for?

    - Representational State Transfer (REST)

2. REST APIs are designed around a resources.

3. What is an identifier of a resource? Give an example.

    -  "order" in this url: `https://catssupplies.com/order`

4. What are the most common HTTP verbs?

    - GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

5. What should the URIs be based on?

    - they should be based on nouns(resource)

6. `https://catssupplies.com/orders/`

7. What does it mean to have a â€˜chattyâ€™ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?
    - Chatty servers are a bad thing. They send large amounts of small resources, instead of sending like data in a bigger resource.

8- 11:

- GET: retrieves representation of resource at URI.
- POST: creates new resource at URI.
- PUT: creates/replaces resources at URI.
- PATCH: partial update of resource.
- DELETE: removes resource at specified UR!
