### Command Line

A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. This is where you enter commands to find information or alter your system among other things. 
Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you.

Basic commands:
- pwd: print working directory; show you where you're current location withing your system
- ls: list; lists items in your current directory (folder)
- cd [location]: change directory
- paths get you to specific file or directory in system; 2 types:
  - absolute: specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. always begin with foward slash ( / ) 
  - relative: where you're currently at; no foward slash. 

### Files

Everything is a file! Files can have extensions or not. Linux is case sensitive so double check, always. 
- file: obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
- ls -a: list the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
