# Emotional Awareness

I would like to work on being a stronger leader. I tend to doubt myself and my abilities a lot. I work well in teams. The only obstacle thats standing in my way is my lack of confidence and self-doubt. 

## Assesing Bias

My strongest points are empathy and curiosity and meaningful connections. I believe that creating an inclusive environment propels all individuals to grow and bring out the best in themselves. My weakest point is still self-care. I need to remember to step away from the screen. The work will suffer if I don't listen to my body and take steps to reduce my anxiety.
