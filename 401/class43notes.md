# 43. Open-Source Software Contribution
Contributing to open source projects can be a great way to improve coding skills. You can gain and improve skills and also recieve feedback. 

Contributing to OSS allows developers to become better at reading code produced by others, finding and fixing bugs, and adding their code into the main repository. These are all activities developers experience working in a tech company.

Contributing doesnt have to be just writting code. You can contribute by making suggestions, editing, formatting, refactoring file structures  etc.
