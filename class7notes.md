# Class Seven Notes 

## Control Flow

The way computers reads the script, usually from top to bottom.
Conditionals, go in order. "If this equals this, stop here, if not keep going until something matches" 

Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

## Java Script Functions

A JavaScript **function** is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

Code defined once, but can be used many times with many different arguments to produce different results. 

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it). written like:

**function** *function name*(parameters){code executed}

- function is the keyword
- function name can contain letters, numbers and dollar signs 
- can include multiple parameters seperated by comma
- code executed goes in curly brackets

Function invocation; something "calls" the function
- event ex: click of a button 
- can be automatically invoked?

Function return: when JS reaches return statement, function stops. 

## Operators

equals sign is an assignment operator doesnt mean equal
