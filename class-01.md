    <summary> Browser application progamming interfaces (APIs)</summary>
    <p>- built into web browsers; dynamic HTML & CSS styles
    - generating 3D graphics/audio
    - manipulating stream from user webcam

- Third party APIs allow devs to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers

- Third-party frameworks/libraries you can apply to HTML</p>

## Variables
variables= containers that store values.

- Values are assigned by using equal sign
- Case sensitive
- Cant start with numbers, use camel case.
  - can use numbers, letters, $ or _

### Variable data types:

| Variable | explanation | example |
| ----- | ------------ | -------- |
|String| enclosed in single, double quotes or backticks| let myVar= 'bob';|
|Number|numbers, including float| let myVar= 10;|
|Boolean|True or False|let myVar= true; |
|Array| structure allowing us to store multiple values in single place| let myVar = [ 1, 'bob'];|
|Object| can be anything, everything in JS is an object and can be stored in variable | let myVar = document.querySelector('h1';)|

<summary>&#128209;Getting Started Questions</summary>

This topic is imporant because JavaScript is a dynamic language. It has many different functions from front end to backend, it's versatile. 

1. Web address is translated into an ip address using DNS. Three way handshake is then performed (TCP Handshake); establishing communication between two parties over using HTTPS protocol. After synchronizations and acknowledgements are sent back and forth, a connection is established.
HTTP GET request is sent from user= get HTML file. packet with 14kb of data is received by user. More packets are sent, after each is acknowledged by user.

2. After first packet is receivedm parsing happens(building of page). HTML, CSS, and JS have to be parsed before anyting is on screen. HTML-->skeleton(DOM tree) CSS-->makeup(CSSOM tree) JavaScript-->muscle, dynamics(abstract syntax tree)
render->interactivity->done
3. Google search is a good place to search for images, using license filter to choose Creative commons licencses. 
4. Strings are created by encapsulated characters in between quotation marks, single or double. Numbers are integers with or without decimals, they dont have quoatation marks.
5. Variable is an object that stores values.
