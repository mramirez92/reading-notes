Yellow, my name is Monica Ramirez. A couple of my farvorite things are working out :weight_lifting_woman: and **_sleeping_**.

To me the growth mindset means effort is required for building new skills, failing included. Failure is part of the path to the mastery of a new skill.

 &nbsp;

Three things to remind  myself on how to stay in the growth mindset:
- Everyone starts as a beginner.
- It's supposed be hard and thats okay.
- Trust the process.
